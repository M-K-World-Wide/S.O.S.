# 🧠 S.O.S. Project Memories & Development Log

## 📅 Session History

### Session 1 - Project Initialization (Current)
**Date**: December 2024
**Status**: ✅ In Progress

#### 🎯 What We Accomplished
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- ✅ Set up package.json with all necessary dependencies for full-stack development
- ✅ Configured TypeScript with strict settings and proper module resolution
- ✅ Created environment configuration template (env.example)
- ✅ Established project structure and documentation standards

#### 🏗️ Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Technology Stack Selection**:
   - Backend: Node.js + Express.js + TypeScript
   - Frontend: React.js + TypeScript + Vite
   - Database: PostgreSQL with Knex.js ORM
   - Real-time: Socket.io + MQTT for IoT communication
   - Caching: Redis for session and data caching

2. **Project Structure**:
   - Separated client and server TypeScript configurations
   - Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
   - Comprehensive documentation structure

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Input validation with Joi
   - Rate limiting and security headers

#### 🔄 Next Steps
- [ ] Create core server setup and Express.js configuration
- [ ] Set up database models and migrations
- [ ] Implement authentication system
- [ ] Create React frontend with Vite
- [ ] Set up MQTT client for sensor communication
- [ ] Implement real-time monitoring dashboard

#### 💡 Key Insights
- The project requires both real-time IoT communication and traditional web interfaces
- Security is critical for medical/industrial oxygen systems
- Modular architecture will allow for easy scaling and maintenance
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring are essential for system reliability

#### 🚨 Important Notes
- All environment variables must be properly configured before running
- Database setup requires PostgreSQL installation
- MQTT broker setup needed for sensor communication
- Development environment should support both frontend and backend simultaneously
